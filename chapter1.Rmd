I just picked this course from University of Helsinki course catalog.

### Feelings about the course
I am really **excited** to learn R, because I want to get new tools to help me to process data. I usually use Excel and as a software engineer it would be better to use my current skills at their maximum.

The first examples were really basic, but I found it interesting because the idea on learning this kind of programming language is to get things done quickly.
